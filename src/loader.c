 Other things you can try: Allocate and initialise memory

New can use kcalloc (allocate and zero) instead of kalloc to allocate memory and intialise it (that is, fill it with '\0's) otherwise the variables will be filled with garbage which you will then need to clear manually. (The standard implementations of operator new() and operator new[]() do not initialize the memory returned.)
Other things you can try: Placement new

In C++, and especially in OS code where structures can be found at fixed addresses, it can be useful to construct an object in memory obtained elsewhere. This is accomplished through a technique known as placement new. As an example, say you wanted to create an APIC object at address 0x09fff0000. This snippet of code will use placement new to do the trick:

 void* apic_address = reinterpret_cast<void*>(0x09fff0000);
 APIC* apic = new (apic_address) APIC;

In order to use placement new, you need special overloads of the new and delete operators defined in scope. Fortunately, the required definitions are simple and can be inlined in a header file (the C++ standard puts them in a header called <new>).

 inline void* operator new(uint_t, void* p)   throw() { return p; }
 inline void* operator new[](uint_t, void* p) throw() { return p; }
 inline void  operator delete  (void*, void*) throw() { };
 inline void  operator delete[](void*, void*) throw() { };

The above implementation can be potentially unsafe for allocating memory, since your kernel does not mark the memory that was allocated as being used. Placement new is hardly ever used, and if you wish to read an object from a specified address in memory, it is usually easier to create a pointer to that address. liballoc does not support placement new.

You never call placement delete explicitly (it's only required for certain implementation detail reasons). Instead, you simply invoke your object's destructor explicitly.

#if 0     STL, RTTI, 
 Builtins

GCC provides several standard library functions as builtins, which you most likely do not want in your kernel binary either. Disable them with -nostdlib

Note: the option -ffreestanding, usually recommended in kernel tutorials, cannot be used with G++.
Why?

Library routines are almost always OS-dependent. You can't mix code for two operating systems in a single operating system â€” it wouldn't work.

TODO: why -ffreestanding/--freestanding do not work.
Run-time type information

Run-time type information is used for typeid and dynamic_cast, and requires run-time support as well. Disable it with -fno-rtti.

Note that RTTI is required for some C++ features. If you disable it, you won't be able to use typeid or dynamic_cast. Virtual functions should work without RTTI, though.
Why?

RTTI stands for Run-Time Type Identification. A kernel has no access to run-time features, which are most likely operating system-dependent.
Exceptions

Another feature that requires run-time support. Disable them with -fno-exceptions.
Why?

Exceptions require code to unwind the stack while looking for an appropriate exception handler to handle the exception. Usually, this code is linked in with your C++ application, but in a freestanding kernel the code must be provided manually.
